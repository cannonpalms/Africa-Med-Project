Using GitHub with Eclipse
==================

Download and follow the instructions found on http://eclipse.github.com/.


Using JUnit
==================

Workflow:

  1. Write/modify code.
  2. Create one JUnit Test Case per class you wrote/modified. Follow namespace patterns. If you create a class `Person`, you should name the JUnit Test Case `PersonTests`.
  3. Write one JUnit test (in a method annotated by the `@Test` annotation before the method) per method in your code.
  4. Fix your bugs (assume your tests may be bugged as well), and when all tests pass, *commit your changes to the DEVELOPMENT BRANCH. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. DON'T COMMIT OR PUSH YOUR CODE DIRECTLY TO THE MASTER BRANCH PLEEEEEASE.*
  5. ???
  6. Profit.
